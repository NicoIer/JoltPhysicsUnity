# JoltPhysicsUnity 

This package provides __work-in-progress__ bindings for [Jolt Physics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics)
specifically for Unity. It uses the Unity.Mathematics package for all numerics and Unity.Collections
package for unmanaged collections.

The C# API is almost entirely implemented on unmanaged structs, making it suitable for use from
Unity Jobs and Burst compiled code.
